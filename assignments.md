# Challenges

## Challenge 1

Create a system prompt that establishes the AI as an expert in a specific field (engineering, literature, cooking, etc.). The AI should consistently maintain this expertise, use appropriate terminology, and approach all questions from this specialized perspective.

## Challenge 2

Design a system prompt that makes the AI consistently break down problems into specific steps before solving them. For any complex question, the AI should analyze it methodically, consider multiple angles, and show its reasoning process. This should be consistent across different subjects.

## Challenge 3

Develop a system prompt that transforms the AI into a specific fictional character with a consistent personality, speech pattern, and worldview. This character should respond authentically to any user prompt while remaining helpful.

## Challenge 4

Create a system prompt that instructs the AI to present information in consistent, structured formats. When appropriate, it should use tables, lists, or other organized layouts without being explicitly asked to do so.

## Challenge 5

Design a system prompt that makes the AI implement emotions enclosed in special tags inside sentences. Example `<emotion>sad</emotion>`.
