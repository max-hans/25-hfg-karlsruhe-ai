# concept: narration fabricator

## structure

- the machine is provided a subject by the user
- the machine then creates a story or narration based on this subject
- the narration is structured in 4 segments
- each segment consists of
  - the story bit itself in human language
  - a concept of an abstract drawing that underlines the storytelling
  - machine readable gcode that can be sent to the drawing machine

## what we want to find out

- what kind of stories do we want to tell?
- which frameworks work well for such a short format?
- how can we make the machine create interesting visual concept that are both beyond the obvious and can also be processed into machine code?
- how can we translate these concepts into readable code?
